New year. So far, so good.

The "Twisted Tea" scene is puzzling. I'm watching a lot of my suburban white friends glorify street violence, where an intoxcated man gets hit in the face with a two pound weight, punched repeatedly when he was down, and then choked. Yes, the kid was a jerk. Yes, his attacker had suffered through racism his entire life. No, the kid didn't deserve to be near hospitalized, and no, we shouldn't enjoy watching what is only a couple steps removed from the Django Unchained slave fight, or make memes about it like it was funny.

I've seen this type of thing many times on tech forums, and I have also felt burnout myself, and felt disenchanted with the state of the software engineering ecosystem, hiring practices, trends in the startup industry, and the unmistakable fact that my hair is now much greyer than my peers'.

The conversations in these threads are a good representation of the problems in software jobs. Hiring is painful. Conversations about "process" take on a life of their own. The hastily written v1 software that started the business is broken in 100 ways, and management is resistent to the idea that fixes are needed and new features should be written with more thought and care. Engineers are ornery and antagonistic to management and each other. There are always low-skill politicians, vying to gain favor, position, and money, at the expense of others.

Good companies exist, good executives and middle management exists, well-written software exists, and patient, kind, and curious engineers exist. I've met those people, and I've worked with those companies, and in my 25 years of being in tech, I've built thousands of great memories, and scores of lifelong friendships. Lastly, I get paid to think and type, and untangle problems, and collaborate with people on both sides of my current skill level. I grant that there are some ugly things in the world of software writing, but the good outweighs the bad, and as an engineer I feel joyous much more than I feel bleak.
