# About Bytes

This site is an experiment in minimalism. The platform is "serverless", backed by an S3 bucket, a Lambda@Edge function to handle templates and markdown, and a CloudFront cache. The page layout is purposefully sparse, and the code is readable, with a small footprint.

My intended content is tech deep dives, small experiments, and musings on life and politics.

# About Curtis

I'm [Curtis Autery](mailto:curtis@autery.net), a software engineer who has been around a while, a dad several times over, husband to a witchy dressmaker and women's studies major, who I suspect is smarter than me. Over the years she has given me beautiful children, and helped me find blind spots keeping me from being a better feminist.

I teach tech to kids whenever that's possible. In the post-covid world that's a little harder, but I hope to get back in the game once the world rights itself. I've taught for Girls Who Code at the University of Minnesota, volunteered through Tech Corps for two years in a local elementary school, and directly with schools my daughters attend. We've covered everything from writing a book report in PowerPoint, to creating pixel animations for video games, to programming Teensy and Adafruit dev boards.
